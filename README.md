Adopting programmatic automation of aspects of security assessments can increase the depth and scope of your application testing coverage within the designated time frame of your test cycles. Security test automation is an essential skill for any penetration tester. Penetration Testers are now not just required to run tools, but also find intuitive ways to automated running of these tools, saving them critical effort and bandwidth - custom scripts being one such approach.
